## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jay!
- Full-time Cloud Engineer
- Dev/tech guy helper on the [Brassburg SMP](https://www.minecraftiplist.com/server/BrassburgACreateModServer1.19.2-26937), managing a [datapack](https://github.com/TurnrDev/BrassburgDatapack) and [patching](https://github.com/mrh0/createaddition/pull/731) broken mods
- Made [TrainerDex](https://www.github.com/TrainerDex), sunsetted end of 2023.
- love all things music, maps, public transport, infrastructure and the environment
- Recently I've taken an interest in games... development and modding. I'm just messing around with some things at the moment, so don't take any of those projects seriously.
