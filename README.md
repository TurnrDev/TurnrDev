## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jay!
- Full-time Cloud Engineer 
- Made [TrainerDex](https://www.github.com/TrainerDex), sunsetted end of 2023.
- love all things music, maps, public transport, infrastructure and the environment
- Recently I've taken an interest in games... development and modding. I'm just messing around with some things at the moment, so don't take any of those projects seriously.
